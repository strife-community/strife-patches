Hero_Rip_role
Hero_Rip_lore													Rip, swordsman of the wastes, hails from a mysterious tribe of Elves – the Kenar-Ahdam – that eek out an existence in the ruins of Strife where they have been effectively exiled to by the other races of Gael as a result of suspicions that they are half-Dharkwave/half-Elf. As perpetual outcasts, the Kenar-Ahdam have remained largely insulated from the worlds around them and have preserved many of their old customs including Rhen-Dhit wherein the second son of the family is sent off to find fortune on their own so as not to challenge the first son for inheritance. Tyme, second son of Mhernad, ventured forth to join in the Trials of Strife in order to win himself a place within his tribe, and his tribe a place amongst the rest of the races of the planes.

Trixie, who had been experimenting with spells she shouldn’t have been near by, managed to avoid that terrible fate by riding away on the hobby horse broom - named Tempest - that her Mom had made to keep her occupied. Alone, distraught, and scared, Trixie happened upon a lone Rafink gunslinger who was laying low in jungle. The two struck up a friendship born of their shared hatred of the occupiers from Gael and under the Rafink’s tutelage, Trixie learned the skills that would earn her the title of “fastest wand in the West(ern Swamps)” and pave her path to the Trials of Strife.
